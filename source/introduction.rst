Introduction
------------

*ClearMap* is a toolbox for the analysis and registration of volumetric
data from cleared tissues.

*ClearMap* has been designed to analyze terabyte-sized 3D datasets obtained
via light sheet microscopy from iDISCO+ cleared tissue samples
immunolabeled for proteins.

*ClearMap* has been written for mapping immediate early genes [Renier2016]_
as well as vasculature networks of whole mouse brains [Kirst2020]_

*ClearMap* tools may also be useful for data obtained with other types of
microscopes, types of markers, clearing techniques, as well as other species,
organs, or samples.

*ClearMap* is written in Python 3 and is designed to take advantage of
parallel processing capabilities of modern workstations. We hope the open
structure of the code will enable many new modules to be added to *ClearMap*
to broaden the range of applications to different types of biological objects
or structures.
