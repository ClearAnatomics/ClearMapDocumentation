Once a set of samples have been analysed individually, you can use this
tab to compare the group and perform some statistical analysis. This tab
could also be used to batch process a set of data after their parameters
have been defined in the config files of each individual folder.

*When you click the batch tab, you will be prompted for a results folder
where the combined analysis will be saved.*

.. WARNING::
    Before proceeding, you should ensure that all samples have
    unique ids within your study and that these are defined correctly. The
    best way to do this is to open the individual *sample_params.cfg* files
    and look for the sample_id key.

Sample folders tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Folder picker helper

*When clicked, this button will open a new dialog to help you choose the
samples of your study.*

*First, click the*\ **main folder**\ *button. This is the folder at the
root of your sample folders.*

*The helper will browse this main folder recursively and find all the
sub-folders that correspond to ClearMap samples (using the
samples_params_cfg files).*

*In this window you should select the group number from the drop-down
menu and move to the right column the samples for that group. Once done,
move to the next group. Finally, click OK. You will be able to customise
the names of the groups later in the batch tab.*

Instead of using the Folder picker help you can add your groups
manually by using these options

Group:
    For each group you get the following info
    *Group name / Add Sample Folder / Remove Folder*
    Your files names should be displayed here

Process tab
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/batch/process_tab.png
    :align: left

This is meant to batch process a set of data after their parameters have
been defined in the config files of each individual folder. You can skip
this if you already separately run ClearMap on your samples
individually.

Comparisons tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/batch/comparisons_tab.png
    :align: left

Choose the pairs of groups that you would like to compare.

.. NOTE::
    To make it simpler to reflect on the data, you can select the
    direction of the comparison (e.g. mutant to control or control to
    mutant)

P Values tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. figure:: images/batch/p_values_tab.png
    :align: left

You are now greeted with the p values tab. Here you can compute (**run**)
or **display** previously computed p value maps.

.. figure:: images/batch/p_values.png

    Example p values. Note the label of the region following the cursor.

.. attention::
    Known issues: If ClearMap cannot run the P-values map because the
    samples donâ€™t have the same size, it is likely that the **sample** ->
    **atlas space info** parameters do not match. You should fix this before
    proceeding. A quick way to see this is to check the sample_params.cfg
    files of the individual folders. An other thing you may want to verify
    if the parameters look the same is the file size of the
    density_counts.tif files in the individual folders. You can also check
    the x/y/z dimension of these files in FIJI.

Stats tab
~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: images/batch/stats_tab.png
    :align: left

Finally, you can display (and save) stats for each sample, for each brain region.

.. warning::
    This step **will** fail if some of your samples have the same ID. Please
    make sure this did not happen. You can double check this by looking at the
    sample_id variable in the *sample_params.cfg* file in each folder.
